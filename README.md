# Traffic Signs Classification Web App  

## Overview  
This project is a web application designed for classifying traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system aims to assist drivers by detecting and identifying traffic signs to help them comply with traffic rules and improve road safety.  

## Motivation  
The existing traffic sign classification systems often face challenges such as:  
- Incorrect predictions  
- High hardware costs  
- Complex maintenance requirements  

The proposed system addresses these issues by offering a more accurate and efficient solution through a deep learning-based approach.  

## Features  
- **Traffic Sign Detection:** Detects and classifies traffic signs from input images  
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Provides near-instant results  
- **Accurate Model:** Powered by a CNN architecture for enhanced classification performance  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN implementation)  
- Flask (for web application)  
- OpenCV (for image processing)  

## How It Works  
1. The user uploads an image containing a traffic sign.  
2. The system processes the image using a CNN-based classification algorithm.  
3. The predicted class is displayed to the user, helping inform drivers of potential traffic rules.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic_Signs_Classification_Web_App.git
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the web application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
## Usage
. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

. Upload an image of a traffic sign.

. The web app will classify the traffic sign and display the results.
