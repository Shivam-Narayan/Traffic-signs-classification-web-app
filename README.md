Traffic Sign Classification is employed to detect and classify traffice signs to inform and warn a driver beforhand to avoid violation of rules. There are certain disadvantages of the existing systems, used for classification, like incorrect predictions, hardware cost and maintenance, which are to a great extent resolved by the proposed system. The proposed approach implements a traffic signs classification alogrithm employing a convolutional neural network.
