# 🚦 Traffic Signs Classification Web App

## 📌 Overview
The **Traffic Signs Classification Web App** is a deep learning-powered solution for detecting and classifying traffic signs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. This project aims to enhance road safety by helping drivers recognize and adhere to traffic rules.

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Many traffic sign classification systems struggle with:
✔️ Incorrect predictions  
✔️ High hardware costs  
✔️ Complex maintenance requirements  

This project addresses these issues by providing **a more accurate, efficient, and lightweight deep learning-based solution**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Traffic Sign Detection** – Identifies and classifies traffic signs from uploaded images  
✅ **Real-Time Prediction** – Provides near-instant results with minimal delay  
✅ **High Accuracy** – Utilizes a CNN model for superior classification performance  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive web application for easy usage
